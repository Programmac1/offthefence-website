                <h2>About</h2>
                <p> Our 20s can be the best and worst time of our lives.
                    For many, the endless opportunities to try new things,
                    discover new places and re-define ourselves make it one
                    of the most exciting phases of life,
                    but also one of the most unsettling.
                    Constantly making decisions on the best next step to take
                    can be all-consuming when we are only just getting to know ourselves.

                <p> Me -Dan- (Right) and Rob (Left) are two 25-year-olds from Manchester, UK, who have been friends for over 12 years.
                    We moved to Australia earlier this year and wanted to create a podcast that acted as a guiding 
                    influence and relatable outlet for people our age. The majority of young people grapple with the 
                    pressure to have your life together and find your calling in your 20s. 
                    
                    As two lads who struggled and sometimes still, struggle to cultivate this sense of direction, 
                    our mission is to give you tips and advice to move forward in life, whilst still making the
                    most of these formative years.
